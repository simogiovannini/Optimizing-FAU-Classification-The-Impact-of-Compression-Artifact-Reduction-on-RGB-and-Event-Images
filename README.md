This project investigates the impact of compression artifact reduction on facial action unit (FAU) classification by evaluating the performance of RGB and event-based images within the FACEMORPHIC dataset. We analyze how video compression artifacts affect model accuracy and explore the efficacy of artifact reduction techniques. Using the Recursive Fusion and Deformable Spatiotemporal Attention (RF-DSA) model, designed to mitigate compression artifacts, we aimed to improve the performance of a visual transformer model for FAU prediction. Despite applying artifact reduction to both RGB and event data, our experiments reveal that this approach does not significantly enhance classification accuracy. Artifact reduction techniques failed to provide substantial improvements over compressed video data. This study highlights the need for alternative strategies to improve model robustness against compression artifacts.
